These are some examples of mails I've sent to potential sponsors. There's no one size fits all, since it depends on how well I know the person or company, whether they know about us, have sponsored before, etc, but it might give you an idea.

To InnoQ who sponsored us already at the first workshop:

> Hello Claudia,
>
> I'm writing you because we are busy preparing our second ClojureBridge Berlin workshop. Your support helped us to make the first one a big success, with over 30 attendees, many of whom still continue their Clojure journey in our weekly study group.
>
> Would InnoQ be interested to sponsor us again this time? Besides our eternal gratitude and the knowledge that you're making the tech scene a bit better and more diverse, we also offer some exposure on our own site, the Clojurebridge.org site, during the event, on social media, and on our t-shirts that we hand to coaches and attendees.
>
> We collected a bit more info about sponsoring here: http://clojurebridge-berlin.github.io/sponsor-us
>
> General info about the event can be found on our main site http://clojurebridge-berlin.github.io/
>
> Last time InnoQ sponsored €400 euro. Our biggest sponsor to date chipped in €650, while we've also accepted sponsoring for just €200, so there's a range of options there.
>
> Thanks a lot,
>
> Arne

To Phil from Twilio, after talking to him about sponsoring at the Twilio Christmas party:

> Hi Phil,
>
> 'T was great to see you again yesterday. I hope you had a memorable party night :)
>
> As mentioned I'm on the lookout for kind companies that want to help us make the world a better place by sponsoring ClojureBridge Berlin.
>
> The next workshop is 22/23 of January.
>
> In return for sponsoring we offer exposure during the event (mention and logo at the start and end presentation), you can send us swag to hand out, we will elaborately tweet about your awesomeness, and your logo will grace our website and the ClojureBridge event page.
>
> Of course if you're a major sponsor you can also get a few minutes to introduce yourself to our attendees.
>
> A typical sponsorship is in the 400 to 600 euro range, although that's negotiable.
>
> Our website is at http://clojurebridge-berlin.github.io/
>
> More info about sponsoring you can find here http://clojurebridge-berlin.github.io/sponsor-us
>
> Thanks,

> Arne

To Russ from Cognitect after meeting him at the Ruby User group:

> Hi Russ,
>
> My name is Arne, we chatted for a while about functional Ruby and Clojure at the Ruby user group in Berlin.
>
> I'm one of the organizers of ClojureBridge Berlin. We organized a first workshop in July which was a big success, over 30 attendees and 15 coaches. Now we're working on our second workshop 22 and 23 January.
>
> I was wondering if Cognitect would be willing to sponsor us. In return you get exposure during the event, on social media, on our website, and on the t-shirts.
>
> Typically companies sponsor in the 400 to 600 euro range, but we're already happy with anything from 200 up.
>
> You can find more information about sponsoring at http://clojurebridge-berlin.github.io/sponsor-us

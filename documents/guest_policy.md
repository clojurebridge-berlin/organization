### Guest Policy

The aim of the guest policy is to provide a safe learning environment at our events.

1. The venue is open for attendees, coaches, speakers, orga team, volunteers and invited guests. These are registered in respective registration documents before workshop day.

2. Non-registered people will be turned away at the door. If a non-registered person *must* be admitted, this decision will be made be by at least 2 people of the orga team. These non-registered guests must sign the guest signup sheet.

3. Everyone in the venue must agree to the Code of Conduct. For non-registered guests, this should be a part of the guest signup sheet.

4. Everyone is issued a badge or a name tag, and heavily encouraged to wear this at the venue.

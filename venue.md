## Venue Questionnaire for January 2016 Berlin ClojureBridge

### Space

* Who will be the company's liaison to contact if any questions/problems arise during the workshop?  What is their contact information?  During parts of the workshop will they be on-site?

Franziska (@vsmart) will be the contact bw ClojureBridge and our host Wunderlist. She'll be present for the whole duration of the workshop. All members of ClojureBridge Berlin should have her contact details.

* Which rooms/spaces are available for workshop use?

Wunderlist will host the workshop on the 6th floor of their Berlin office. We will have access to the main group space ("Retro") and the adjacent kitchen, bathrooms and smaller group spaces.

* May we (and _can_ we -- sometimes there are reasons why it's logistically not possible) reconfigure spaces freely, for instance moving desks and tables, as long as we promise to diligently restore their original configuration before leaving on Saturday?

Yes - within reason. The electronics (e.g. beamer, lights, fridges) should not be moved. I'll be around for checking in on this sort of stuff.

* Can the location also be used for teacher training and/or after-party?

Yes.

* What is a suitable space, if any, to put children and a babysitter?

There are in theory few smaller rooms on the same floor. However, we have to double check whether we can offer adequate space for child care.
ETA: No child care was requested by attendees or coaches this time.

### Security

* What arrangements need to be made regarding picking up/dropping off keys?

I will arrange some extra key cards to be available for the events.

* Does there need to be someone down at the door?

Yes. During arrival of attendees, someone will have to stand down stairs to welcome attendees and point them to the 6th floor. We will also a post a sign with contact details in case someone is late.

* Will they require non-disclosure agreements?

No.

* Are there rooms/areas that must be kept off-limits?

Attendees will only have access to the 6th floor of the building.

* Are there any special arrangements to make regarding security?  For example, providing a list of attendee names some number of days/weeks in advance.

No.

* Is there a firm time when they need us to depart, or are they fine with letting us stay until the last person is done? (Particularly relevant for the unpredictable nature of Installfest.)

There is no firm time.

### Equipment

* How many of the rooms/spaces for the workshop have screens/projectors?  Do we need to bring some if we are working in open spaces, or can they lend us monitors to instead plug into?

There is one large projector available to us for presentations.

* Are there Mac and PC adaptors available for each of those screens/projectors/monitors?

Yes, there are adaptors for Mac available. I am not sure about PC adaptors.

* Are there extension cords/connectors that the workshop can use?

Yes. I will arrange to move these to the 6th floor (TODO)

* Is there a microphone and amplified system available to use for the large group announcements sections?

No.

* Is there central air/heat on the weekends? If not, are there extra fans/space heaters that can be used if needed?

Yes, there is heating on the weekends.

* May we use any whiteboards and chalkboards we find in the rooms/spaces?  If so, may we erase whatever is already on those?

Yes (unless it states "Do not erase").

* Anything not-completely-obvious to know about using their equipment?

Not that I'm aware of.

* What is the wifi login?

Posters with the wifi login will be posted at the location (TODO), and we will announce the information.

### Parking

* Is there public parking nearby they can recommend?

I think there is a parking space nearby at Alexanderplatz. More relevant for Berlin, there is plenty of public transport options to get to Alexanderplatz (U-Bahn, S-Bahn, Tram) from which it is only a few minutes' walk to the venue.

* Is there bike parking anywhere in the building that would be available for the workshop?

Unfortunately no. There are, however, bike racks right outside the building.

### Catering

* Which of the meals for the workshop are they planning on covering?

None.

* Would they prefer to arrange any of the food?  Or would they prefer we arrange and have the caterers submit any invoices to the location host?

No.

* Can the caterer accommodate special dietary requests, e.g. food allergies?  Or do they prefer we arrange for those meals separately?

Catering is not handled by Wunderlist.

* If there are snacks/drinks at the office, are these available to people at the workshop?

We can use the water and coffee.

### Cleanup

* Where are trash receptacles?

There are trash bins in the main kitchen on the 6th floor.

* Where are compost/trash/recycle bags located?

Unfortunately the office building does not have any recycling options.

* Where should filled compost/trash/recycle bags be put?

Unfortunately the office building does not have any recycling options.

* Do they have any specific cleanup/composting requirements?

The space should be left as clean as we found it.

* Do we need to wipe down all tables or just handle the trash and put tables back where they were before the event?

We should wipe down the tables as people might eat at them. Again, we'll use common sense to leave the place behind as clean as we found it.

* Would they prefer we use all disposable dishes and utensils?

No. There are dishes available that we can use.

* Would they prefer that we throw out any left over food?  Or wrap it and leave it in the fridge for any of their people?

We are welcome to leave left overs behind as long as they will still be in attractive and edible shape come Monday morning.

### Plug
* When would they like to have a plug?  (Friday night?  Saturday Morning?)  Would they like to make a recruiting pitch too?

Franziska will attend as host/co-organizers and will probably say a few words to welcome people to the space, and maybe a few words about what we do at Wunderlist. However there will be no recruiting pitch.

* Will they have some of their people attending to do this?

 There are also some other Wunderlist people that will act as coaches and a few students but not act in a host-function.

* If no, do they have any specific projects they would like us to mention when weâ€™re giving the plug?

No

* Would they like to provide company-branded stickers for Installfest?

TODO: I will double check regarding this.

* Would they like to provide any other promotional shwag, such as company t-shirts, buttons, etc?

TODO: I will double check regarding this.

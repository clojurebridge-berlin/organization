## Curriculum / Material

For the coaches training we adapted the Teacher Training slides from RailsBridge and made them more suitable to our needs.

* [Original RailsBridge slides](http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/workshop/more_teacher_training) and [source on Github](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/blob/master/sites/en/workshop/more_teacher_training.deck.md)
* [ClojureBridge Berlin Coaches training slides](http://clojurebridge-berlin.github.io/coaches_training.deck.html) and [source on Github](https://github.com/clojurebridge-berlin/clojurebridge-berlin.github.io/blob/master/docs/coaches_training.deck.md)

We had an [introductory talk](https://clojurebridge-berlin.github.io/ClojureBridgeBerlin_Intro_Talk.pdf)

We used the main [ClojureBridge curriculum slides](https://clojurebridge.github.io/curriculum/#/)

We used NightCode as the recommended editor/environment, and installed it by passing around USB sticks at the installfest.

## Signup

We used google forms to register coaches and students

* student form
* coaches form

## Communication

We set up a GMail account (clojurebridge.berlin@gmail.com) that forwards to the organizers.

We tweet as @ClojureBerlin.

Most discussion and tracking of tasks happened through Github issues on the [clojurebridge-berlin/organization](https://github.com/clojurebridge-berlin/organization) repo.

We sent out emails to both coaches and students asking to confirm close to the event, to limit no-shows.

The various emails that went out to attendees can be found here: [All emails to attendees](https://github.com/clojurebridge-berlin/organization/blob/master/all_mails_to_attendees.md).

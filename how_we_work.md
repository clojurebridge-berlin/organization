# ClojureBridge Berlin, Orga 101

If you want to help organize ClojureBridge Berlin, then start by reading this carefully.

## Orga team

Typically there are one or two lead organizers, they are responsible for kicking
things off and bringing together a core orga team.

We divide things in general areas of responsibility, so for each such area there
is an organizer that takes the lead and follows things through, from planning to
workshop to wrapping things up afterwards.

## Organization phases

- Planning; All the stuff that should happen early on. Date, venue, sign-up forms, find sponsors, decide on details for t-shirts, food, etc.
- Pre-workshop ; Prepare and do the teachers training, select and contact attendees, finalize date/time/payment/delivery/pickup details with suppliers.
- InstallFest
- Workshop
- Aftermath ; Make sure finances are wrapped up, capture retrospective, invite people to join/form study groups.

## Communication channels (in order of importance)

To follow up on tasks (things that you can mark as done) we use Github issues on the clojurebridge-berlin/organization repo. This way we have a public and persistent record, and it's easy to get an overview.

People can contact us at clojurebridge.berlin@gmail.com. You can set this up to forward to your own email. When replying to others (e.g. attendees, sponsors), you can cc this email address so people see what’s been said, and so we have a record of that.

We also use the Google Docs associated with that account. Signups of attendees and coaches end up in a spreadsheet there. Any documents (bills, receipts) should ideally also be added there. Or if you’re too lazy for that at least email them to the gmail address.

There’s http://clojuredojo.slack.com/ for general chat. Try not to use it for decision making since that way we have no record of it. For coordinating in the moment (“I’ll be there to open the door at 9”) it’s great. You can use this on your phone as well.

There’s the global ClojureBridge workshops mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojurebridge-workshops. ClojureBridge recommends that organizers sign up to that, but that’s up to you. It’s low traffic, and a few of us are already on there. Announcement and retrospective of the workshop should be posted there.

Finally there are two private groups on http://clojureverse.org, one with only organizers, one with all organizers, past attendees, and coaches. These are probably most useful for sending out announcements to the group.

## How to do things

Start by looking how we did it the last time (e.g. check the [fact book](https://github.com/clojurebridge-berlin/organization/blob/master/2015-07-11-factbook.md)). If that isn't clear, or you want to do things differently, open a Github issue for discussion. Gather people's input, aiming for concensus, and then take that into account when making a decision.

## Finances

Keep all receipts! Even for small stuff like nametags or pens, we'll collect them all and make sure you get refunded.

We work with Travis Foundation to handle the finances, so donations can be made to Travis Foundation, and suppliers can invoice them.

In some cases a sponsor will pay directly for a specific item on the budget (for example, t-shirts), in which case the supplier can invoice directly to the sponsor and we are out of the picture (easy for us).

You can forward all official looking paperwork, (receipts, invoices, contracts), to the person doing the finances. That makes it easy to keep track of the budget, and to keep references for the future ("how many t-shirts did we order last time?").

# Clojure Bridge Berlin Organization

This repository is used by the orga-team to plan and coordinate [ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/) Berlin. 
Which is a free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshop for women.  

We document our organization in our [WIKI](https://github.com/clojurebridge-berlin/organization/wiki). There you find information on how to join our team and e.g. all the mails we send to participants.

In our [issues](https://github.com/clojurebridge-berlin/organization/issues) you find all information about decisions that were made and their history.
All information about our past events can be found in our [fact books](https://github.com/clojurebridge-berlin/organization/blob/master/2016-01-22-factbook.md).

# Clojure Bridge Berlin Organization 
Currently we are planning [ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/) Berlin!
Which is a free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshop for women.  

This repo is used by the orga-team to plan and coordinate.
In our issues you find all information about our sponsors, finance and decisions that were made.

If you organize an event yourself please feel free to use the information you find in our repo including the mail in English and German we published [here](https://github.com/clojurebridge-berlin/organization/blob/master/all_mails_to_attendees.md).

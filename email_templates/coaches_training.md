Hi everyone,

You're getting this email because you filled out the form to be a coach on the
upcoming ClojureBridge Berlin workshop. Thanks a lot, we're very happy to have
you on board!

As mentioned on the sign up form, we will have a "coaches training" evening,
next Thursday, 14 January, at Wunderlist, at 19:00. There will be food!

We do this to

* go over what it means to be a good teacher and to be sensitive to the students' needs
* go over some practical things
* agree on the workshop approach and curriculum

We start at 19:00 with some food and give people a chance to arrive and say hi.
After that we will go over some practicalities to make sure everyone is on the
same page. Afterwards, the bulk of the evening, is centered around group
discussion of various topics.

This event is not optional, even if you were with us before we would still
really like to see you there. If you can't make it to the this evening, or you
can't make it to the workshop after all, please let us know as soon as possible.

To remind you: the workshop itself is on Friday 22 (InstallFest) and Saturday 23
January.

To give you a small update, we have gotten a massive amount of sign-ups this
time, more than twice the amount of attendees we had last time. Meaning: we can
use all the coaches we can get! So if you have a friend or colleague that is can
coach please bring them along. They can still fill out the form, or just bring
them to the training and we'll sort it there.

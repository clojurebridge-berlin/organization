> Hello Monstas!
>
> There's a ClojureBridge workshop happening next month. Clojure is a programming language that in some ways is a bit similar to Ruby, but that's also very different. You can use it to make web apps, or do creative stuff with visuals and sound.
>
> The workshop is open for people identifying as women, all levels are welcome. You can sign up here https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yoZVmo4Z8umpO9hmYB32WBv2Tpmjsgxv3zR5rFspvYA/viewform

> The workshop takes place on Friday 22 and Saturday 23 January 2016, at Wunderlist/Microsoft close to Alexanderplatz.

> Have a look at our website if you want to learn more, or just send me an email if you have any questions

> At the workshop we work towards programming visuals with a library called Quil. You can try it out in your browser to see how that looks with this interactive tutorial:
